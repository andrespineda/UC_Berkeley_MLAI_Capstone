# **Introduction**

This project was developed as the Capstone Project to receive<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Bp7_VYf8ZA2vFHXuMTTi--Xj8srhSidh" width="200" align="right">
a UC Berkeley Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The six-month program provides you with the tools and knowledge to thrive in this evolving field. It equips you with a comprehensive foundation in ML/AI as well as advanced knowledge in data analytics, deep neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), and generative AI. The program provides practical insights into the business applications of ML and AI technologies(UC Berkeley Executive Education., n.d.)
## **Methodology**

The Data Analysis will use the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) method
(Schr√∂er, et al, 2021) of data analysis.

**CRISP-DM**

The CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) approach
to data analysis involves six major steps as outlined below:

1. **Understanding the Business:** This initial step involves conducting an
    in-depth analysis of the business objectives and needs. It includes
    assessing the current situation, defining goals based on insights, and
    setting up a plan to proceed.

2. **Understanding the Data:** In this phase, data is collected from various
    sources, its format and type are determined, and the data is profiled.
    Tasks include exploring the data, describing it, and ensuring its
    quality, accuracy, and validity.

3. **Data Preparation:** Careful selection, cleansing, construction, and formatting of the data are carried out in this step. The data are organized for modeling, and information exploration is conducted to
identify patterns aligned with business insights.

4. **Modeling:** The modeling phase involves selecting modeling techniques,
    generating test scenarios for validation, building various models, and
    assessing them to ensure alignment with business objectives

5. **Evaluation:** During this phase, the results of the models are evaluated
    against business intentions. Multiple models are assessed to determine
    which one best meets the project's goals.

6. **Deployment/Communication:** The final step involves presenting the
    gathered information in a usable manner to stakeholders according to
    their expectations and business requirements. This phase may vary in
    complexity based on numerous factors.
